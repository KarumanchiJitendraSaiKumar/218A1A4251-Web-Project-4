  <p>Tirupati is a city in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Its Sri Venkateswara Temple sits atop one of the the 7
    peaks of Tirumala Hills, attracting scores of Hindu pilgrims. Sri Venkateswara National Park, home to the temple,
    also contains the Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park with lions and primates. Nearby, next to a waterfall and cave
    believed to be sacred, Sri Kapileswara Swamy Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva.The Tirupati Balaji temple is rightly
    called the Bhuloka Vaikuntam â€“ the abode of Vishnu on earth. Thus, it is believed that Lord Vishnu has manifested
    Himself in this temple during this Kali age to guide and direct His devotees towards salvation.Devotees cannot look
    directly into the eyes of the Lord as they radiate cosmic energy. This is the reason why Lord Venkareshwara eyes are
    closed with a white mask. But every Thursday, the eyes are relatively small, so the mask is moved, and the devotees
    can glimpse the deity's eyes.

  <p>This sacred hill is located in the temple town of Tiruvanamalai, and geologists claim that it is one of the oldest
    mountains in the world. The Annamalaiyar Temple, a temple of Lord Shiva is located at the base of the hill. The hill
    is also known by the names Annamalai, Arunagiri, Arunachalam, Arunai, Sonagiri, and Sonachalam. Many sages and
    saints are drawn to this mountain owing to the sacred and spiritual nature of the place. Usually temples are found
    at the very top of a hill and hold a sacred place in the hearts of devotees, but it is only here in Tiruvannamalai
    an entire hill is considered sacred and worshipped as a symbol of Lord Shiva, or a lingam.Girivalam is an ancient
    tradition performed by devotees, that involves circumambulating the holy Arunachala Hill in Tiruvannamalai. The
    Girivalam Road is a 14 km long route, with 8 different lingams en route. Girivalam is usually done every Full Moon
    day, and lakhs of devotees partake in this spiritual walk.</p>
